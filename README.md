Play my game at: chouske.github.io
Continuous inputs include going left and right, and discrete inputs are for jumping and double jumping(you can hold to double jump, or release up on jump and then tap it again mid-air to double jump at that specific time)
The goal is achieved by moving the player to pickup all the apples in each stage
There are story scenes to contextualize the gameplay scenes
There are 3 physics based levels
I drew all of my assets in the program paint.net, and a few were from the previous project but not many, and were also drawn in paint.net
