A simple adventure game by Chase Houske based on a simple adventure game engine by [Adam Smith](https://github.com/rndmcnlly).

Code requirements:
- **4+ scenes based on `AdventureScene`**: unsatisfied (name at least 4 of the classes).
    There are four rooms of the zoo, room1, room2, room3, and room4
- **2+ scenes *not* based on `AdventureScene`**: unsatisfied (name the classes).
    Intro and outro
- **2+ methods or other enhancement added to the adventure game engine to simplify my scenes**:
    - Enhancement 1: unsatisfied (name the method and explain the use of it).
        shake() adds a shaking tween to the input object(an animal)
    - Enhancement 2: unsatisfied (name the method and explain the use of it).
        pickupandtext() picks up an item and prints some text, both being function inputs

Experience requirements:
- **4+ locations in the game world**: unsatisfied (name at least 4 of the classes).
The four exhibits of the zoo are the monkey, elephant, jaguar, and giraffe exhibits
- **2+ interactive objects in most scenes**: unsatisfied (describe two examples)
In each scene you can interact with the animals; in scene 1 you can also pick up your backpack and in scene 3 you can pick up an apple
- **Many objects have `pointerover` messages**: unsatisfied (describe two examples)
Hovering over unreachable objects tells you you can't reach them, and you get info on animals by hovering on them
- **Many objects have `pointerdown` effects**: unsatisfied (describe two examples)
You can interact with animals and pick up items
- **Some objects are themselves animated**: unsatisfied (describe two examples)
Animals move when you interact with them

I drew everything on my own
